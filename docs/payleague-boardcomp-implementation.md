# Implementation: payleague.asp and boardcomp.asp

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented and optimized two director pay and board composition routes for the Webb-site Flask migration:

1. `/dbpub/payleague.asp` - Director pay league table
2. `/dbpub/payleagueorg.asp` - Company pay league table
3. `/dbpub/boardcomp.asp` - Board composition analysis (already existed, fixed and optimized)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed boardcomp.asp (webbsite/routes/dbpub.py:6730)

**Issues Found (2025-10-26 - Second Fix):**
1. Missing WHERE clause for `positions.rank = 1` filter - was in JOIN condition instead
2. Using `COUNT(d.director)` instead of `COUNT(DISTINCT d.director)` causing duplicate counts
3. Missing `title` variable in template rendering
4. Query returned `orgid` instead of `personid` (inconsistent with ASP original)

**Issues Found (Initial Fix):**
1. Used incorrect column `pn.postype` instead of `pn.status` for INED filtering
2. PostgreSQL `::date` type cast syntax incompatible with SQLAlchemy parameterized queries

**Changes:**
- **CRITICAL:** Added `WHERE pn.rank = 1 OR d.director IS NULL` after LEFT JOINs (line 6821)
- Changed `COUNT(d.director)` to `COUNT(DISTINCT d.director)` to avoid counting multiple positions per person
- Changed column alias from `orgid` to `personid` to match ASP original
- Added `title` variable to render_template call
- Updated template to use `board.personid` instead of `board.orgid`
- Fixed INED filtering to use `pn.status = 3`
- Rewrote query to match original `hkbdanalsnap` stored procedure logic
- Removed dependency on non-existent `listedcoshk` table
- Changed `%s::date` to `CAST(%s AS date)` for SQLAlchemy compatibility
- Optimized query structure with proper CTEs

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The critical bug was in how the `positions.rank = 1` filter was applied:

**WRONG (what we had):**
```sql
LEFT JOIN enigma.positions pn ON d.positionid = pn.positionid AND pn.rank = 1
GROUP BY ...
```

This includes ALL directorships, but with `pn` fields NULL for non-rank-1 positions. The GROUP BY then counts all of them.

**CORRECT (MySQL original):**
```sql
LEFT JOIN (directorships,people,positions)
 ON t2.issuer=directorships.company
 AND directorships.positionID=positions.positionID
 AND directorships.director=people.personID
WHERE positions.rank=1 AND ...
GROUP BY issuer
```

The WHERE clause filters AFTER the join, effectively turning it into an INNER JOIN on positions with rank=1.

**CORRECT (PostgreSQL equivalent):**
```sql
LEFT JOIN enigma.directorships d ON t2.issuer = d.company
LEFT JOIN enigma.people p ON d.director = p.personid
LEFT JOIN enigma.positions pn ON d.positionid = pn.positionid
WHERE pn.rank = 1 OR d.director IS NULL
GROUP BY ...
```

The WHERE clause filters out directorships where position is not rank 1, while preserving companies with no directors via `OR d.director IS NULL`.

**Impact:** HKEX showed 57 directors instead of 13 (440% overcounting). All companies had inflated director counts by including non-board positions.

**Query Pattern:**
```sql
-- Find all listed issuers (Main Board and GEM)
-- Join with directorships active at snapshot date
-- Filter to board positions only (positions.rank = 1)
-- Count DISTINCT directors per company
-- Aggregate INED counts, gender, age
-- Calculate percentages
```

### 2. Implemented payleague.asp (webbsite/routes/dbpub.py:5694)

**Features:**
- Year selection (2005-2024)
- Currency conversion (HKD, USD, CNY, EUR, GBP, etc.)
- INED-only filter
- Exclude share-based pay option
- Sortable columns (Fees, Salary, Bonus, Retirement, Share-based, Total, Count)
- Limit 1,000 records

**Key Logic:**
- Joins `pay` → `documents` → `payfx` → `people`
- Currency conversion via `payfx` table (exchange rates at financial year-end)
- INED filtering via subquery checking `directorships` status at pay date
- Aggregation by `pplid` (person ID)

**Template:** `webbsite/templates/dbpub/payleague.html`

### 3. Implemented payleagueorg.asp (webbsite/routes/dbpub.py:5864)

**Features:**
- Same filters as payleague.asp but aggregated by company
- Year selection (2005-2024)
- Currency conversion
- INED-only filter (for INED pay only)
- Exclude share-based pay option
- Limit 10,000 records

**Key Differences from payleague:**
- Aggregates by `orgid` instead of `pplid`
- No "Count" column (shows all pay components per company)
- Links to `/dbpub/pay.asp` instead of `/dbpub/offpay.asp`

**Template:** `webbsite/templates/dbpub/payleague_org.html`

## Database Optimizations

Created migration: `migrations/add_boardcomp_payleague_indexes.sql`

**Indexes Added:**

1. **idx_directorships_dates** - Speeds up director date range filtering
   ```sql
   ON enigma.directorships (company, apptdate, resdate)
   ```

2. **idx_stocklistings_dates** - Active listings at date with 2ndCtr filter
   ```sql
   ON enigma.stocklistings (issueid, firsttradedate, delistdate)
   WHERE "2ndCtr" = FALSE
   ```

3. **idx_issue_type_issuer** - Security type filtering
   ```sql
   ON enigma.issue (typeid, issuer, id1)
   ```

4. **idx_stocklistings_composite** - Common listing query pattern
   ```sql
   ON enigma.stocklistings (stockexid, issueid, firsttradedate, delistdate)
   WHERE "2ndCtr" = FALSE
   ```

5. **idx_stocklistings_stockcode** - Stock code sorting
   ```sql
   ON enigma.stocklistings (stockcode, stockexid)
   ```

6. **idx_pay_year_prank** - Pay year filtering
   ```sql
   ON enigma.pay (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM d), prank, orgid, pplid)
   ```

7. **idx_pay_d_currid** - Currency conversion joins
   ```sql
   ON enigma.pay (d, currid, orgid)
   ```

8. **idx_payfx_lookup** - FX rate lookups
   ```sql
   ON enigma.payfx (d, repcurr, dispcurr)
   ```

9. **idx_documents_pay_filter** - Pay data availability
   ```sql
   ON enigma.documents (orgid, doctypeid, recorddate, pay)
   ```

## Templates

Both templates follow the original ASP design:

**Common Elements:**
- Navigation tabs (By director / By company)
- Filter form (Year, Currency, INED-only, Exclude share-based)
- Notes about data completeness
- Sortable table headers with up/down arrows
- Number formatting with thousands separators

**Responsive Design:**
- Uses `colHide3` class to hide detail columns on mobile
- Form controls with auto-submit on change

## Testing

**Routes Verified:**
- ✅ `/dbpub/payleague.asp` - Returns data, renders correctly
- ✅ `/dbpub/payleagueorg.asp` - Returns data, renders correctly
- ✅ `/dbpub/boardcomp.asp` - Fixed and optimized, now returns results

**Performance:**
- boardcomp: Optimized with new indexes (was very slow, now acceptable)
- payleague: Fast with proper indexes on pay table
- payleagueorg: Fast with proper indexes

## Dependencies

**Database Tables:**
- `enigma.pay` - Director pay records
- `enigma.payfx` - Currency conversion rates
- `enigma.documents` - Financial report dates and pay flag
- `enigma.people` - Person names
- `enigma.directorships` - Director positions and dates
- `enigma.positions` - Position details (status, rank)
- `enigma.organisations` - Company names
- `enigma.issue` - Securities
- `enigma.stocklistings` - Stock codes and listing dates
- `enigma.currencies` - Currency names

**Helper Functions:**
- `get_int()` - Safe integer parameter extraction
- `get_bool()` - Boolean parameter parsing
- `get_str()` - String parameter extraction
- `execute_query()` - Database query execution

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Caching:** Add caching for currency lists (rarely changes)
2. **Pagination:** Add pagination for large result sets
3. **Export:** Add CSV export functionality (like original ASP)
4. **Year Range:** Allow selecting multiple years for comparison
5. **Charts:** Add visualization of pay trends over time

## Notes

- Pay data starts from 2005 (Listing Rules requirement)
- Currency conversion uses year-end exchange rates via `payfx` table
- INED filtering requires checking director status at time of pay record
- Some companies don't disclose pay data (tracked in `documents.pay` flag)
- Share-based pay can be excluded from totals for fairer comparison

## Important SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL Note

**Type Cast Syntax:** When using parameterized queries with SQLAlchemy, always use SQL standard `CAST(value AS type)` syntax instead of PostgreSQL's `value::type` shorthand. The `::` operator conflicts with SQLAlchemy's parameter placeholder syntax and causes syntax errors.

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - causes "syntax error at or near ':'"
sql = f"SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM %s::date)"

# ✅ CORRECT - works with SQLAlchemy
sql = f"SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CAST(%s AS date))"
```
