<h2>About Renavon Hong Kong Total Returns</h2>

<h3>What are Total Returns?</h3>
<p>Total Return (TR) is the return to an investor who bought a security and held it,
assuming all dividends and other distributions were reinvested in the same security at the
closing price on the ex-dividend date. This gives a true picture of investment performance,
unlike simple price appreciation which ignores income.</p>

<h3>Calculation Methodology</h3>
<p>Renavon Hong Kong Total Returns are calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Start with the closing price on the first trading day</li>
    <li>Adjust for all corporate actions (splits, consolidations, bonus issues, rights issues)</li>
    <li>Add back all dividends, assuming reinvestment at the ex-dividend closing price</li>
    <li>Express as an index with base 100 on the first trading day</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adjustments for Corporate Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Splits and Consolidations:</strong> The number of shares is multiplied by the split ratio.
A 1-for-2 consolidation means you have half as many shares worth twice as much each.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Issues:</strong> Additional shares received for free increase your shareholding without
changing the total value (initially).</p>

<p><strong>Rights Issues:</strong> If you subscribe to your entitlement, your cost base increases by the
subscription amount. If you don't subscribe, your percentage ownership is diluted.</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>All data comes from Hong Kong Exchange Daily Quotations Sheets and official announcements.
Historical data extends back to 1994-01-03 for Main Board stocks.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Assumes perfect reinvestment at ex-dividend closing prices (not always achievable in practice)</li>
    <li>Ignores transaction costs, taxes, and bid-ask spreads</li>
    <li>Does not account for opportunity cost of rights subscription capital</li>
    <li>Past performance is not indicative of future results</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using Total Returns</h3>
<p>Total Returns are useful for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Comparing performance across securities with different dividend policies</li>
    <li>Evaluating fund manager performance against benchmarks</li>
    <li>Long-term investment analysis</li>
    <li>Academic research on market efficiency</li>
</ul>
