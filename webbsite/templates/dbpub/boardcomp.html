<h2>{{ title }}</h2>
<p>In some countries, governance experts get excited about the proportion of
independent non-executive directors on a board, overseeing the management of the
company. A majority is deemed ideal. Of course, this presumes that the INEDs
are independent of management, which is impossible if the management are
also the controlling shareholders of the company and can vote on the election of
INEDs in shareholder meetings. So in HK, where almost all companies have
a controlling shareholder, INEDs are more form than substance. Listing Rules
since 30-Sep-2004 require each listed company in HK to have 3, and from 31-Dec-2012 they should
constitute at least 1/3 of the board. We also track the gender and ages of
directors.</p>

<p>Here is a table of the number of directors of each company who
are claimed to be independent and are subject to election in shareholder
meetings (INE), the number of directors who are female, and the
proportions they represent of the board, for each company with a current HK primary
listing. Click on the column headings to sort the
list. Use the snapshot feature to roll back the clock - we have all directors since 1990, including delisted companies
up to the delisted date. Current company names are
used.</p>
