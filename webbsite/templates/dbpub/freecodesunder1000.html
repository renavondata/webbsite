<h2>Available stock codes under 1000</h2>

<p>As the number of listings has increased, the stock code space has become
increasingly crowded. So if you are thinking of listing on the main board, and
would like a short stock code under 1000, which
stock codes are currently unused? This page will tell you. To find out what the
codes have been used for in the past, if anything, click on the code.</p>

<table class="optable">
    {% for code in unused_codes %}
        {% if loop.index0 % 10 == 0 %}<tr>{% endif %}
        <td style="width:40px"><a href="/dbpub/code.asp?code={{ code }}">{{ code }}</a></td>
        {% if loop.index % 10 == 0 or loop.last %}</tr>{% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
