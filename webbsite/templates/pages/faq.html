<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>General Questions</h3>

<h4>What is the Renavon Hong Kong Database?</h4>
<p>The Renavon Hong Kong Database is a comprehensive archive of Hong Kong financial market data spanning over 35 years (1990-2025). It contains information about listed companies, directors, beneficial ownership, corporate actions, SFC licensees, solicitors, and much more.</p>

<h4>Is this data free to use?</h4>
<p>Yes! The database was released under the <strong>Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0</strong> license in October 2025. You are free to use it for commercial or non-commercial purposes, as long as you attribute Webb-site.com as the source.</p>

<h4>What is the relationship with Webb-site.com?</h4>
<p>This database contains data originally compiled by <a href="https://webb-site.com" target="_blank">Webb-site.com</a>, founded and operated by David M. Webb MBE since 1998. David generously open-sourced the database schemas and scrapers in October 2025 to preserve public access to this valuable Hong Kong financial data.</p>

<h4>Are Webb-site articles included?</h4>
<p>No. The <strong>editorial content</strong> from Webb-site Reports (articles, analysis, opinions) remains copyright David M. Webb and is NOT included in this database. Where articles are referenced, we link to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/webb-site.com/articles/" target="_blank">Archive.org</a> preserved copies.</p>

<h3>Data Coverage</h3>

<h4>What time period does the data cover?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stock Quotes</strong>: Daily since 1994-01-03</li>
<li><strong>CCASS Holdings</strong>: Daily since 2007-06-26</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Actions & Directors</strong>: Since 1990</li>
<li><strong>SFC Licensees</strong>: Since 2003-04-01</li>
<li><strong>HK Solicitors</strong>: Current with historical moves</li>
</ul>

<h4>How often is the data updated?</h4>
<p>Different data sources are updated on different schedules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock quotes and CCASS: <strong>Daily</strong></li>
<li>Financial reports: <strong>Continuous</strong> monitoring</li>
<li>SFC licensees & HK solicitors: <strong>Daily</strong></li>
<li>Companies Registry: <strong>Weekly</strong></li>
<li>UK Companies House: <strong>Continuous</strong> via API</li>
</ul>

<h4>What makes CCASS data special?</h4>
<p>Our CCASS holdings data goes back to <strong>2007-06-26</strong>, while HKEX public data only shows 1 year of history. This allows analysis of long-term beneficial ownership trends. Once a stock is delisted, HKEX deletes the data immediately, making historical CCASS data unrecoverable without independent archiving.</p>

<h3>Using the Database</h3>

<h4>How do I search for a company?</h4>
<p>Use the <strong>Company Search</strong> box at the top of any database page. You can search by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company name (English or Chinese)</li>
<li>Stock code (e.g., "5" for HSBC)</li>
<li>Incorporation number</li>
</ul>

<h4>How do I search for a person?</h4>
<p>Use the <strong>Person Search</strong> box at the top of any database page. Enter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family name</strong> in the first box (e.g., "Webb")</li>
<li><strong>Given name(s)</strong> in the second box (e.g., "David")</li>
<li>Check options for exact match vs. full-text search</li>
</ul>

<h4>How do I find CCASS holdings for a stock?</h4>
<p>There are several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for the company, then click on <strong>CCASS</strong> links in the navigation</li>
<li>Use <a href="/ccass/bigchanges.asp">Top CCASS Changes</a> to see recent significant changes</li>
<li>Use <a href="/ccass/cconc.asp">CCASS Concentration Analysis</a> to analyze ownership concentration</li>
</ul>

<h4>What are "Webb Total Returns"?</h4>
<p>Webb Total Returns (WTR) measure stock performance including both capital gains and reinvested dividends. This gives a more accurate picture of investment returns than price changes alone. See <a href="/dbpub/TRnotes.asp">About Total Returns</a> for methodology details.</p>
