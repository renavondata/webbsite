<p>Thank you for contributing to corporate transparency in Hong Kong! This table excludes David Webb and his staff. At the end of 
2024, the top 2 volunteers by valid submissions will be invited 
to lunch at the Hong Kong Club with David Webb, if he is medically able.</p>
<p>Accuracy is the ratio of (1) valid submitted pay-lines entered and submitted to (2) total lines entered plus lines 
corrected or added after submission. We only show this for editors with at least 200 valid pay-lines who have made a 
submission in the last 14 days. If you are inactive for 14 days then your rank will drop to 1, so that others with 
higher rank can correct any errors if you have left the project. Accuracy tends to 
improve as you gain experience. Currently editors in the top half by accuracy have editing rank 2 and are able to edit 
pay-lines for those with an editing rank of 1. Click on the Username to see which pay-years the editor has submitted. 
Ranks are recalculated daily.</p>
