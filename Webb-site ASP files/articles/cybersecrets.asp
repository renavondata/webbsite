	<div class="summary">Government-owned Hong Kong Cyberport Development Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries were incorporated in December 1999, but refuse to publish any of their accounts. What is the Government trying to hide? We also take a look at the controversial West Kowloon project, the winner of which will be determined by Government in a highly subjective process.</div>

<h2 class="center">Cyberport Secrets<br>
<span class="headlinedate">24 October 2004</span></h2>
<p>It's no secret that <i>Webb-site.com</i> was opposed to the Cyberport project from 
the outset, on the grounds that it represented unnecessary government 
intervention in the property sector and, most importantly, that the 24-hectare 
waterfront project was 
awarded to a developer without tender. The fact that the developer was a son of 
Li Ka-shing, a long-time business partner of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung 
Chee Hwa before he was selected to run the territory, raised obvious concerns.</p>

<p>In fact, we were the first publication to
<a target="_blank" href="cybervillas.asp">point out</a> on 22-Mar-99 that the 
Government's claim that <i>&quot;two-thirds of the site will be for Cyberport 
development&quot; </i>obscured the fact that only 17% of the floor area was for 
offices, while 76% was residential, a 2,900-unit project now known as
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.residencebel-air.com/">Residence Bel-Air</a> 
or, misleadingly, &quot;Bel-Air on the Peak&quot; in its latest phase, which of course is 
closer to sea than summit. The TV ad campaign featured a woman flouncing around 
a stunning villa which in fact was not in Pokfulam but was the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.villa-ephrussi.com/">Villa Ephrusi de 
Rothschild</a> in the South of France. The illusion even extends to
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/20040802/00432/EWF105.pdf">
page 11</a> of the annual report of <a target="_blank" href="../dbpub/articles.asp?p=3387">Pacific 
Century Premium Developments Ltd</a> (0432) where you will find a picture of the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.villa-ephrussi.com/ephrussi/decouvertes/uk_decouvertes_2.htm">
gardens</a> of the French Villa opposite a description of the Cyberport.</p>

<p>Our ground-breaking commentary on the Cyberport earned us the unwelcome attention of the Kroll 
private investigation firm, which <a target="_blank" href="kroll.asp">hired</a> 
a man posing as a journalist to probe our coverage. We turned the tables on him 
and Kroll, resulting in front-page coverage in the local press and questions 
about the freedom of speech in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Five years later</h3>

<p>Now fast forward to 2004. Five years on, the Cyberport portion of the project is finished, 
and very shiny and nice it is too. We never doubted it would be well built, we 
just don't think the Government should have been involved. Now it is the 
outright owner of all portions of the project except the residential part, 
where it will receive a share of the profit (if any) on the development, net of 
Cyberport construction costs, to reflect the land input. The profit-sharing 
ratio has never been disclosed, but was based on the peak cash outlay from PCCW 
(however fleeting) relative to the value of land contributed by the Government.</p>

<p>Recently we went to the movies at the Cyberport, ate in the hotel, and wandered around 
the shopping mall. It all echoes somewhat, because it is still largely empty, and 
no business person would want to stay in the 5-star hotel unless they were 
either doing business in the project or enjoyed getting away from the hustle and 
bustle of the business district. But as the offices 
fill up over time, that should solve itself, and as the residents move in, the 
mall should come to life. There is still the long-term hope of an MTR line to 
connect the project to the North of the island and bring in traffic.</p>

<h3>Secret accounts</h3>

<p>The Cyberport is managed by a Government-owned company called Hong Kong 
Cyberport Management Co Ltd (<b>HKCM</b>) which was incorporated in Dec-99. In 
fact, although HKCM is the public face of the Cyberport, with a
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200306/10/0610166.htm">
board</a> which includes outside directors, there are
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200005/17/0517170.htm">
three companies</a> involved - Hong Kong Cyberport Development Holdings  Ltd (<b>HKCDH</b>) 
and its two subsidiaries, HKCM and Hong Kong Cyberport (Ancillary Development) 
Co Ltd (<b>HKCAD</b>). HKCDH holds the master title to the land and granted 
sub-leases over the Cyberport portion to HKCDH and over the residential portion 
to HKCAD.</p>

<p>Under Section 111 of the Companies Ordinance, the companies must hold their 
first AGM within 18 months, by Jun-01. That means that the first audited 
financial statements would be for a period which ended before then, since 
accounts must be prepared for each AGM. As the 
Government's normal reporting year ends on 31st March, we can 
assume that the first accounting period ran to 31-Mar-01. By now, HKCDH and its 
subsidiaries should have 4 sets of audited financial statements. </p>

<p>So we went to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberport.com.hk/">Cyberport</a> web 
site and searched for the statements. No luck. Perhaps the failure to post them 
was just an oversight, we generously thought. So we wrote to the appointed 
Chairman of HKCM, Mr John Strickland, who also happens to be a fellow director 
of <a target="_blank" href="../dbpub/articles.asp?p=9643">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd</a> (0388), of which your editor is a 
director. It turns out that this withholding of information is not an accident, 
but  policy. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;I do not expect that we will be publishing an Annual Report until the 
project is substantially complete.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Leaving aside the fact that the project <u>is</u> substantially complete (the 
Cyberport portion was
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200306/27/0627212.htm">
opened</a> on 27-Jun-03 and officially completed on 28-Jun-04), 
that is no excuse for secrecy over the accounts of publicly owned 
assets. How can you have accountability without accounts? </p>

<p>As of 8-Jun-00, the date the development right was granted, the Government
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200008/03/0803155.htm">agreed a figure</a> 
of HK$7.8bn (US$1bn) just for the land value of the residential portion of the 
project which, as you know, only occupies 1/3 of the site. Overall then we are 
talking about an opportunity cost of <b>US$3bn</b> in land, being the estimated 
fair market value of the whole site at that time if it had been sold off for 
residential purposes. The public has a right to know whether it is getting value 
for money, and how the project is being managed.</p>

<p><b>We call on the Government to publish all the audited financial statements 
from 2001-2004 of 
each of HKCDH and its subsidiaries HKCM and HKCAD without further delay.</b></p>

<p>There is a useful comparison to be made with another Government property 
company with an &quot;incomplete&quot; project, namely the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hkstp.org">Hong Kong Science and Technology 
Parks Corporation</a> (<b>HKSTP</b>), which was established on 7-May-01 after a 
3-way merger of other Government-owned companies. It has published
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hkstp.org/english/aboutus/abt_annual/abt_annual.html">
annual reports</a> for 2001/02 and 2002/03 on its web site. We don't agree with 
the existence of HKSTP, as it is interventionist and has &quot;subsidy&quot; written all 
over it, but at least the accounts are publicly available and open to scrutiny 
or ridicule, as the case may be.</p>

<p>We cannot think of any other government-owned company or &quot;trading fund&quot; (a 
separate financial entity) that does not publish at least financial statements 
and in most cases a full annual report. For example, you can get the annual 
reports of the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hongkongpost.com/eng/news_publications/annual_report/index.htm">
Post Office</a>, the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kcrc.com/eng/corporate/report/index.asp">
KCRC</a>, the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tdctrade.com/abouttdc/annualReport.htm">
Trade Development Council</a>, the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.info.gov.hk/lasc/annual.htm">Legal Aid 
Services Council</a> and all sorts of Government entities online, but not the 
Cyberport.</p>

<p><b>Unless and until the Government publishes the accounts of this 
controversial project, we are left with the unavoidable assumption that there 
may be something in the audited financial statements that they do not wish the 
public to see.</b></p>

<h3>West Kowloon - a Cyberport for the 21st Century?</h3>

<p>Members of the public must also be wondering whether the same veil of secrecy 
will fall over the controversial 40-hectare
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hplb.gov.hk/wkcd/">West Kowloon</a> 
development after it has been awarded. There are some startling similarities. On 
17-Mar-99, Donald Tsang, then Financial Secretary,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/199903/17/0317124.htm">
defended</a> the Cyberport by saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;It is wrong, very wrong, to say the 
Cyberport is a property development&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Uh-huh. And on 5-Sep-03, as Chief Secretary, defending the proposal 
for West Kowloon to 
bundle cultural facilities with the usual mix of shopping malls, hotels, offices and flats in a 
single massive project, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;This is not another property development project. It is about developing a 
new cultural icon for Hong Kong&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Uh-huh. Rather than simply tendering the land in 
manageable parcels, each with designated usage, to the highest bidders, the Government 
plans to award the 
entire project in one massive block, and has come up with
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hplb.gov.hk/wkcd/eng/doc/02_Attachments/Annexes/Annex_3-1.pdf">
assessment criteria</a> involving a large element of subjectivity in which 
&quot;financial proposals&quot; account for only 75 marks out of 300, or 25% of the 
overall scoring. Even then, a comparison between competing financial proposals 
will be difficult because they could involve profit sharing on property development 
(where future profits are unknown), up-front land premiums, revenue sharing or 
royalty payments. Applicants are even invited to suggest what plot ratio  they had in mind. It makes the assessment process one of comparing 
apples and oranges and selecting the &quot;best&quot; fruit.</p>

<p>And if this is not a property project, then why is it that you don't even 
qualify to participate unless you have experience of developing at least one 
project with a construction cost of at least HK$3bn, and of marketing and 
leasing property developments with a floor area of at least 250,000 sq. m. 
(2.69m sq ft) at any one time?</p>

<p>The deadline for submissions has passed, and there are
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hplb.gov.hk/wkcd/eng/doc/20040705LegCoPL_e.pdf">
5 proposals</a>. However, one of them is from an unknown individual called &quot;Lam, 
Sze-tat&quot; and probably won't pass the qualification criteria unless he is 
fronting for a large developer. Another, from <a target="_blank" href="../dbpub/articles.asp?p=384">
Swire Pacific Ltd</a> (<b>Swire</b>, 0019/0087), was
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail_frame.cfm?articleid=49114&intcatid=42">
innovative</a> but probably breaches the tender criteria by proposing a 
&quot;cultural harbour&quot; involving other government sites, including the existing 
Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui and the Tamar site, which just happens to sit 
between the harbour and Swire's Pacific Place, a view which Swire would 
presumably be keen to protect with low-rise development at Tamar. The Government 
has
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail_frame.cfm?articleid=49302&intcatid=42http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail_frame.cfm?articleid=49302&intcatid=42">
indicated</a> that Swire's proposal is likely to be rejected.</p>

<p>That just leaves 3 viable proposals. <a target="_blank" href="../dbpub/articles.asp?p=412">
Henderson Land Development Co Ltd</a> (0012) is going in alone through a 
subsidiary called &quot;World City Culture Park Ltd&quot;, while
<a target="_blank" href="../dbpub/articles.asp?p=488">Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd</a> (<b>CKH</b>, 
0001) and <a target="_blank" href="../dbpub/articles.asp?p=417">Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd</a> (<b>SHKP</b>, 
0016) have teamed up in a rare joint venture called &quot;Dynamic Star International 
Ltd&quot;. The third contender is &quot;Sunny Development Ltd&quot;, a 4-way joint venture 
between <a target="_blank" href="../dbpub/articles.asp?p=342">The Wharf (Holdings) Ltd</a> (0004),
<a target="_blank" href="../dbpub/articles.asp?p=664">Sino Land Co Ltd</a> (0083), K. Wah 
International Holdings Ltd (0173) and <a target="_blank" href="../dbpub/articles.asp?p=1579">Chinese 
Estates Holdings Ltd</a> (0127), which
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharfholdings.com/news/20040621144721.doc">
proposes</a> a mixture of canopies and trees which again may be ruled as 
non-conforming.</p>

<p>The CKH/SHKP venture is tipped to win, not least because SHKP
<a href="../codocs/0016_020228pr.pdf" target="_blank">sponsored</a> the Norman Foster design team that won the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hplb.gov.hk/competition/">Concept Plan 
Competition</a> in the first place. The design, which was adopted by Government, 
features a gravity-defying roof which rises slowly from the East to West and 
should ensure that there is no high-rise element in front of the buildings in
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtrcorp.com/eng/properties/content-overview-kol.htm">
Union Square</a>, the 13.5 hectare MTR project surrounding Kowloon station where 
Sun Hung Kai just happens to be developing
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.shkp.com.hk/html/kln_station/english/home.html">
Packages 3, 5, 6 and 7</a>.</p>

<p>After passing through a Government &quot;Proposals Evaluation Committee&quot; and 
various other steps (including public exhibition) aimed at giving the appearance 
of propriety, Hong Kong's Chief Executive, whose decision will be final, will 
choose the winner. The subjective assessment leaves it open to Government to 
choose whoever they want to win the project.</p>
