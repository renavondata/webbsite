copyright in facts (data), but there is copyright in the arrangement of
data and in the software that I wrote to collect the data. I make all of

It is my hope that at least one public interest entity will continue my
legacy by building on these datasets and making them freely available on
the web.

**Mirror this repository**

Please feel welcome to create mirrors (copies) of this “Webb-site
Repository” on your own server, ideally with public access, so that if
anything happens to the original Google Drive folder after my death then
copies will still be available on the internet.

Your copy must include this document.

Carpe diem!
