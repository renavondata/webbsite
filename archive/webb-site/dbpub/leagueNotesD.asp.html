<h2>Notes on Webb-site Director League Tables</h2>
<ul class="navlist">
	<li id="livebutton">Notes</li>
</ul>
<div class="clear"></div>
<ol>
	<li>Each League Table shows the number of positions of each 
	director, 
for companies with a primary listing on either the Main Board or Growth 
Enterprises Market (GEM) of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd. We don&#39;t 
	include REITs, because they are trusts, not companies, and the directors you 
	might think of are actually directors of the REIT manager.</li>
	<li>There are two options: current positions for current listed 
	companies, or current &amp; past positions, which includes delisted companies 
	and past directorships. In the latter case, a person could count more than 
	once per company if he left the board for at least 1 day and returned after 
	that.</li>
	<li>The CAGR relative return is the average of the Compound Annualised Growth Rates in the 
	Webb-site Total Return of the ordinary shares of the company of which the 
	person was a director, relative to the Tracker Fund of HK, for the period in which he held that position 
	or from 12-Nov-1999 if he joined earlier than that date. For a 
	detailed explanation of Webb-site Total Returns, <a href="TRnotes.asp">click 
	here.</a></li>
	<li>If you only look at current positions, then the returns exclude the past 
	directorships, including any companies which went bust and were delisted, so 
	there is a possible &quot;survivor bias&quot;.</li>
	<li>In the League Table, click on a director's name to see the underlying 
	directorships, and total returns for each company. You will be taken to the 
	summary for that person. To see the individual positions he has held, click 
	on "All Ranks". The league table looks at the whole period of directorship, 
	regardless of whether the director held different titles within that period. </li>
	<li>On the directorships page, click on the company name 
	to see all the directors of that company. Click on a total return figure to 
	see the chart of total return for the ordinary shares of that 
	company. Click on the &quot;Current&quot; button to hide the historical positions (in 
	which case the average only includes current positions). Click on the 
	&quot;History&quot; button to show the historic positions.</li>
	<li>&quot;Current&quot; directorships may be outdated if the companies are 
	unlisted or delisted and therefore do not announce subsequent changes in 
	their directorships.</li>
	<li>Directorships of less than 180&nbsp;calendar days are ignored in the 
	CAGR, because short periods can produce 
	distorted annualised returns. To be 
	exact, we need a trading day on or after the day of appointment, and another 
	trading day at least 180 calendar days after that, for the total return to 
	be included in the CAGR.</li>
	<li>If a director was appointed before 3-Jan-1994, 
	then total returns are measured from that date onwards, because that&#39;s when 
	<em>Webb-site Total Returns</em> begins. We exclude returns for directorships which ended by 3-Jan-1994 (plus 180 
	days) for the same reason.</li>
	<li>If a director was appointed while a stock was suspended, then the 
	returns are measured from the first day on which it resumes trading, and the 
	closing price that day forms the base for the total return.</li>
	<li>We try to capture all directorship appointments and removals as they become known. 
	Sometimes we are a few days behind when staff take holidays. </li>
	<li>For directors who have only had a few appointments, the average relative 
	return may be 
	less significant. Their companies may have encountered good fortune or misfortune, or 
	their companies' stocks may have been pumped or dumped.</li>
	<li>There is not necessarily any causal relationship between individual 
	directors and 
	returns, and none is implied by Webb-site. However, you would expect that 
	the directors of a company collectively do have an impact on returns, 
	because they direct the company&#39;s affairs.</li>
	<li>As always, click on a column-heading to sort.</li>
