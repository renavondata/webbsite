2. 🚧 govac.asp - 1 hour
3. 🚧 ccassStats.asp - 1 hour
4. 🚧 eventsCSV.asp - 1 hour

## Velocity Metrics

**Historical performance:**
- Oct 27: 14 routes in 9 hours = 1.56 routes/hour
- Best session: 3 routes in 45 min = 4.0 routes/hour

**Remaining estimates:**
- High priority (21 routes): 13 hours at 1.6 routes/hour
- Medium priority (7 routes): 8 hours at 0.9 routes/hour
- Total: 21 hours for 28 routes

**Target by Oct 31:**
- Conservative: 155 working routes
- Realistic: 160-165 working routes
- Optimistic: 170-175 working routes
- **Current: 147 working routes** (already exceeds MVP!)

---

## Conclusion

The webb-site migration has achieved **excellent coverage of core functionality**:
- 52% of all routes working (147/284)
- 80% of dbpub routes working (127/158)
- 95% of CCASS routes working (18/19)
- All high-traffic pages functional
- Production-ready for Oct 31 cutover

**Priority remains matching dbpub and CCASS functionality** - mission largely accomplished! Remaining work focuses on lower-traffic specialty pages and post-launch features.
