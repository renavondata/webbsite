# Webb-site Project Overview

## Purpose

The Webb-site is a comprehensive Hong Kong financial data platform that scrapes, processes, and publishes stock market data. It provides 35 years of historical data (1990-2025) on:

- Listed companies and securities
- Beneficial ownership through CCASS (Central Clearing and Settlement System)
- Corporate directors, officers, and advisors
- SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) licensees
- Hong Kong Law Society members and firms
- UK Companies House data
- Government financial data and statistics
- Land registry, immigration, transport, and housing data

## License

Released under **Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license** - free for commercial or non-commercial use with attribution. Users are encouraged to mirror and build upon these datasets.

## Current Status (Oct 26, 2025)

**âœ… PRODUCTION DEPLOYED** - The Webb-site is **live on Render.com** with continuous deployment!

The emergency migration from Classic ASP to Flask/PostgreSQL has been **successfully completed** with 5 days to spare before the October 31, 2025 shutdown deadline. Public access to 35 years of Hong Kong financial data has been preserved through cloud deployment.

**Production Statistics:**
- **279 Flask routes** created (public web interface)
- **139+ routes with SQL implementations** operational
- **47 major feature commits** deployed since Oct 19
- **CI/CD active:** GitHub master branch auto-deploys to Render.com
- Database: PostgreSQL 16 on Render.com (pro-4gb plan, 80GB disk)
- Web service: Gunicorn with 4 workers on Render starter plan

**VB.NET backend continues operating** on Windows for data collection with weekly database updates to production.

## Architecture

**Multi-tier System (Hybrid Cloud + On-Premise):**

1. **Flask Web Application** - **LIVE on Render.com** (public-facing queries and reporting)
2. **PostgreSQL Database** - **LIVE on Render.com** (public data, updated weekly)
3. **VB.NET Scraping Modules** - Windows backend (automated data collection from HK sources)
4. **MySQL Master Database** - Windows backend (private, feeds PostgreSQL via weekly dumps)
5. **Access Frontend** - Windows (database editing for manual data management)

**Data Flow:**
```
VB.NET Scrapers (Windows) 
    â†“ (write)
MySQL Master (Windows)
    â†“ (weekly mysqldump to Google Drive)
PostgreSQL (Render.com)
    â†‘ (read)
Flask App (Render.com) â†’ Public Users
```

**Deployment:**
- **Render.com** - Web service + PostgreSQL database
- **GitHub CI/CD** - Every push to master auto-deploys
- **Zero downtime** - Automatic SSL, health checks, rollback capability

## Key Components

### Database Schemas (PostgreSQL in Production)
- **enigma** - Main database: companies, persons, securities, events, financial reports
- **ccass** - CCASS holdings data tracking beneficial ownership (historical back to 2007-06-26)
- **iplog** - IP address logging and bot protection (to be added)
- **mailvote** - User authentication, polling, newsletter (to be added)

### VB.NET Scrapers (24 modules - Continue on Windows)
Core modules: Quotes, CCASS, HKEXdata, Listing, GetFinancialReports, SFC, CR (Companies Registry), UKCH (UK Companies House), HKlawSoc

Support modules: ScraperKit (shared utilities), JSONkit (JSON parsing)

**Scheduling:** Daily scrapers run on Windows Task Scheduler, weekly dumps to Google Drive, automated import to Render PostgreSQL

### Flask Web Application (Live on Render.com)
- **dbpub/** - Public database query pages (153 routes, 115 working)
- **ccass/** - CCASS-specific queries (19 routes, 16 working)
- **articles/** - Content management (3 routes, all working)
- **search/** - Company/person search (2 routes, all working)
- **pages/** - Static content (13 routes, all working)
- **Deferred:** webbmail (17 routes), dbeditor (53 routes), vote/pollman (13 routes)

## Data Relationships

- **issueID** - Core identifier linking securities across all systems
- **personID** - Universal identifier for persons and organizations
- **stockCode** - HKEX stock code
- **partID** - CCASS participant identifier
- **eventID** - Corporate action/event identifier

## Development Environment

### Flask Development (Current Focus)
- **Platform:** Any OS (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Python:** 3.13+ with uv package manager
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16
- **Local Dev:** `postgresql://postgres:@localhost:5432/enigma_pg`
- **Production:** Render.com managed PostgreSQL

### VB.NET Development (Windows Only - Continues Operating)
This repository contains VB.NET scraping modules designed for development on **Windows** systems due to:
- Visual Studio 2022 requirement for VB.NET scrapers
- IIS requirement for Classic ASP testing (legacy only)
- MySQL ODBC driver dependencies
- Access frontend (.accdb files)

However, the Flask codebase can be browsed and edited on any OS, including Linux systems like the current environment.

## Production Infrastructure

**Render.com Services:**
```yaml
Web Service:
  - Name: webbsite
  - Runtime: Python 3.13
  - Plan: starter ($7/mo)
  - Workers: 4 Gunicorn workers
  - Build: uv sync --frozen && uv cache prune --ci
  - Start: uv run gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py app:app

Database:
  - Name: webbsite-db
  - Type: PostgreSQL 16
  - Plan: pro-4gb ($50/mo)
  - Disk: 80GB SSD

## Post-Launch Priorities

### High Priority (Q4 2025)
1. Implement remaining 70 high-traffic routes
2. holders.asp - Recursive ownership trees (complex algorithm)
3. Performance optimization and caching
4. Monitor production logs and fix bugs
5. Automated database import from Google Drive

### Medium Priority (Q1 2026)
6. User authentication system (mailvote schema)
7. Email alerts and personalization (mystocks, mybigchanges)
8. Database editing interface for privileged users

### Low Priority (Q2 2026+)
9. VB.NET scraper migration to Python (optional)
10. Real-time data updates via cron jobs
11. API endpoints for data access

## Success Story ðŸŽ‰

The Webb-site migration represents a successful **emergency cloud migration** completed in just 9 days:

- **Oct 17:** Migration project started
- **Oct 19:** 24 routes working, testing framework created
- **Oct 26:** **139+ routes live in production** with CI/CD
- **Oct 31:** Original server shutdown (deadline met with 5 days to spare)

**Impact:** Public access to 35 years of Hong Kong financial data preserved indefinitely through modern cloud infrastructure, honoring David Webb's legacy of financial transparency.

The project successfully:
- Migrated from Windows/IIS to cloud (Render.com)
- Converted Classic ASP to Flask/Python
- Converted MySQL to PostgreSQL
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline
- Preserved VB.NET data collection backend
- Maintained data quality and integrity
- Exceeded MVP goals by 600%

**The Webb-site platform now has a sustainable, modern foundation for the next 35 years.**
