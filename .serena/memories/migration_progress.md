# Migration Progress Log

## Latest Status (Oct 27, 2025 - Afternoon Session)

### Production Deployment
- âœ… Site live on Render.com with continuous deployment
- âœ… 153 routes working with full SQL implementation (165% over MVP target!)
- âœ… 57 stub routes remaining (20% of total)
- âœ… Database operational in production (PostgreSQL pro-4gb, 80GB disk)

### Afternoon Session Accomplishments (Oct 27 - Phase 1 Complete)

**MAJOR MILESTONE: Financial Functions Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰**

**1. MySQL â†’ PostgreSQL Function Porting (10 functions):**
   - âœ… getAdjust(issueID, date) - Cumulative adjustment factor
   - âœ… firstQuoteDate(issueID, date) - First trading date with price
   - âœ… lastQuoteDate(issueID, date) - Last trading date with price
   - âœ… splitadj(issueID, date) - Split adjustment multiplier
   - âœ… totRet(issueID, fromDate, toDate) - Total return calculation
   - âœ… totRetDays(issueID, fromDate, days) - Total return over N days
   - âœ… CAGRet(issueID, fromDate, toDate) - Compound Annual Growth Rate
   - âœ… CAGretDays(issueID, fromDate, days) - CAGR over N days
   - âœ… CAGrel(issueID, fromDate, toDate) - CAGR relative to HSI tracker
   - âœ… CAGrelDays(issueID, fromDate, days) - Relative CAGR over N days

**2. buybacks.asp Route Implementation:**
   - 211-line Flask route with comprehensive logic
   - 181-line Jinja2 template with responsive design
   - Three frequency views: daily, monthly, yearly
   - Split-adjusted vs raw share counts toggle
   - Dynamic sorting by 12 different columns
   - CCASS settlement date integration
   - Currency-based aggregation
   - Outstanding shares calculation with historical lookups

### Key Technical Achievements

**MySQL â†’ PostgreSQL Conversion Patterns:**
- `EXP(SUM(LOG(x)))` â†’ `EXP(SUM(LN(x)))` (multiplicative aggregation)
- `IFNULL(x, y)` â†’ `COALESCE(x, y)` (null handling)
- `INTERVAL syntax` â†’ `INTERVAL '1 day' * n` (date arithmetic)
- `MAKEDATE(y, 1)` â†’ `MAKE_DATE(y, 1, 1)` (date construction)
- `YEAR(date)` â†’ `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)::INTEGER` (date parts)
- `CONCAT(y, '-', m, '-', 1)` â†’ `MAKE_DATE(y, m, 1)` (date building)

**Testing Results:**
- All 10 functions tested with historical HSBC (issueID 5) data
- splitadj() returns 1.0 correctly for periods without splits
- totRet() calculated 13.7% return over 2.5 years (1997-1999)
- CAGRet() annualized to 6.5% CAGR over 3.5 years
- CAGrel() returns 1.0 when comparing HSI to itself (validation âœ“)

### Database File Growth
- dbpub.py: 13,833 â†’ 14,044 lines (+211 lines, +1.5%)
- migrations/: New 001_financial_functions.sql (437 lines)
- templates/: New buybacks.html (181 lines)

### Session Summary
**Phase 1: Database Functions Complete (4 hours)**
- 10 functions ported and tested âœ“
- 1 major route implemented âœ“
- Migration infrastructure established âœ“

**Unblocked Routes:**
- buybacks.asp âœ“ (DONE - just deployed!)
- buybacksum.asp (depends on buybacks.asp)
- buybackstime.asp (depends on buybacks.asp)
- listed.asp enhancements (return calculations)
- delisted.asp enhancements (return calculations)
- Performance comparison routes
- 6-8 additional routes that use these functions

### Key Metrics
- Total routes created: 279
- Working routes: 153 (55% - up from 152!)
- Stub routes: 57 (20%)
- Missing routes: 69 (specialty/admin pages)
- Functions ported: 10/10 (100%) âœ…
- Procedures pending: 2 (ListCosByMktAtDate, hkbdanalsnap)
- **Session progress: +1 route, +10 functions (+0.4% routes, CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE)**

### Next Priorities

**Phase 2: Stored Procedures (2-3 hours):**
1. **ListCosByMktAtDate(date)** - Market listing counts
   - Used by: listingtrend.asp
   - Simple aggregation, easy to port
   
2. **hkbdanalsnap(date, orderBy)** - Board composition analysis
   - Used by: boardcomp.asp, dirsHKPerPerson.asp, latestdirsHK.asp
   - More complex, joins directorships with demographics

**Phase 3: Simple Buybacks Routes (2 hours):**
- buybacksum.asp - Market-wide buyback summary
- buybackstime.asp - Time-series analysis
- Both are aggregation variants of buybacks.asp

**Phase 4: Director Statistics (4-6 hours):**
After procedures ported:
- boardcomp.asp - Board composition per company
- dirsHKPerPerson.asp - Directors per person distribution
- latestdirsHK.asp - Latest director appointments

**Phase 5: Simple Routes (4-6 hours):**
Can work in parallel:
- short.asp - Short selling positions
- shortsum.asp - Short selling summary
- incHKsurvive.asp - Company survival analysis
- regHKannual.asp - Annual registration stats
- domregHK.asp - Domicile registration stats

### Technical Debt
- Need to test buybacks in production (deployed but untested)
- May need template adjustments based on production data
- Consider adding caching for expensive splitadj() calls
- Index optimization for buybacks aggregation queries

### Historical Context
**Morning session (Oct 27):**
- 4 routes implemented: incHKannual, incHKmonth, incHKcaltype, disHKcaltype
- Google Charts integration for trend visualization

**Previous sessions (Oct 24-26):**
- 148 routes implemented
- Basic infrastructure and templates established
- CCASS routes (16), article routes, search routes, etc.

### Estimated Completion
- **Remaining work:** 12-18 hours
- **Routes to complete:** ~20 substantial routes
- **Target:** End of October 2025 âœ“ (ON TRACK!)
- **Actual deadline:** Oct 31, 2025 (site shutdown)
- **Current pace:** 5-10 routes/day
- **Buffer:** 4 days remaining
