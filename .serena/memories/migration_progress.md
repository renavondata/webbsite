# Migration Progress Log

## Latest Status (Oct 27, 2025 - Late Afternoon Sprint)

### Production Deployment  
- ✅ Site live on Render.com with continuous deployment
- ✅ **156 routes working** with full SQL implementation (+3 routes this session!)
- ✅ 57 stub routes remaining (20% of total)
- ✅ Database operational (PostgreSQL pro-4gb, 80GB disk)

### Late Afternoon Accomplishments (Oct 27 - Sprint Mode!)

**BATCH 1: Buyback Routes Complete! (3 routes - 1 hour)**

1. ✅ **buybackstime.asp** (64 lines Flask, 68 lines template)
   - Trailing period selector (10 days to all-time since 1991-11-27)
   - Simple aggregation: SUM(value) GROUP BY issueID, currency
   - Dropdown with 10 preset periods
   - Links to individual buybacks.asp

2. ✅ **buybacksum.asp** (162 lines Flask, 108 lines template)
   - Market-wide buybacks calendar view (year/month/day)
   - Weekend date handling (skip Sat/Sun)
   - Split-adjusted vs unadjusted toggle
   - Uses splitadj() function for adjustment
   - Outstanding shares with historical lookup
   - Sortable by 10 columns
   - Cascading date dropdowns

3. ✅ **domregHK.asp** (58 lines Flask, 58 lines template)
   - Foreign company domicile rankings
   - Simple GROUP BY aggregation
   - Percentage share calculations
   - Sortable by domicile or count

### Technical Highlights

**Buybacks Implementation:**
- Two query variations (adjusted/unadjusted)
- Date range calculation with business day logic
- Subquery pattern for latest outstanding shares
- Split adjustment integration: `os / splitadj(issueid, osd)`
- Dynamic table selection based on adjustment flag

**Performance Considerations:**
- Using enigma.webbuybacks (raw) vs enigma.buybacksadj (pre-adjusted) views
- Efficient DATE BETWEEN queries with indexes
- splitadj() function called in-query (may need caching later)

### Database File Growth
- dbpub.py: 14,044 → 14,342 lines (+298 lines, +2.1%)
- New templates: buybackstime.html, buybacksum.html, domregHK.html (234 lines total)
- Total routes in dbpub.py: **164 routes** (up from 163)

### Session Summary (Late Afternoon)
**Time:** ~1.5 hours
**Routes added:** +3
**Code added:** ~532 lines (Flask + templates)
**Commits:** 3 (functional functions, buybacks batch, domregHK)

### Key Metrics
- Total routes created: 279
- **Working routes: 156 (56% - up from 153!)**
- Stub routes: 57 (20%)
- Missing routes: 66 (specialty/admin pages)
- Functions ported: 10/10 (100%) ✅
- Procedures pending: 2
- **Session progress: +3 routes (+1.1%)**
- **Today's total: +5 routes** (incHKannual, incHKmonth, incHKcaltype, disHKcaltype, oldestHKcos + 3 buyback/stats)

### Routes Ready to Implement (Quick Wins)

**Batch 2: Simple Statistics (3-4 routes, 1-2 hours):**
- incHKsurvive.asp - Company survival by year (with Google Charts)
- regHKannual.asp - Annual registration statistics  
- short.asp - Short selling positions
- shortsum.asp - Short selling summary

**Batch 3: CCASS Routes (identify missing 3 of 19):**
- Need to check which CCASS routes are stubs
- Priority: aggregation/summary pages

**Batch 4: Director Statistics (need procedure first):**
- boardcomp.asp - Requires hkbdanalsnap() procedure
- dirsHKPerPerson.asp - Requires procedure
- latestdirsHK.asp - Requires procedure

### Estimated Remaining Work
- **Simple routes:** 4-6 hours (8-12 routes)
- **Procedure porting:** 2-3 hours (2 procedures)
- **Director routes:** 3-4 hours (3-4 routes after procedures)
- **CCASS completion:** 1-2 hours (2-3 routes)
- **Total remaining:** 10-15 hours
- **Remaining routes to 170:** ~14 routes (realistic target by Oct 31)

### Today's Accomplishments Summary (Oct 27)
**Morning session:**
- 4 routes: incHKannual, incHKmonth, incHKcaltype, disHKcaltype
- Google Charts integration

**Afternoon session:**
- 10 financial functions ported (MAJOR milestone!)
- 1 route: buybacks.asp (complex, 211 lines)

**Late afternoon sprint:**
- 3 routes: buybackstime, buybacksum, domregHK
- **Total today: +8 routes, +10 functions**

### Production Status
**Auto-deployed commits:**
1. Financial functions migration (10 functions)
2. buybacks.asp implementation
3. buybacksum + buybackstime implementation
4. domregHK implementation

All code live on Render.com within minutes of push!

### Next Session Targets
**Highest ROI (maximize routes/hour):**
1. incHKsurvive.asp - Similar to incHKannual (already done)
2. regHKannual.asp - Similar pattern
3. short.asp + shortsum.asp - Straightforward queries
4. Identify and implement missing CCASS routes

**Avoid for now:**
- Complex procedures (time sink)
- Director statistics (blocked by procedures)
- Authentication routes (out of scope)

### Velocity Metrics
- **Routes/hour today:** 8 routes / ~7 hours = 1.14 routes/hour
- **Target pace:** 10-15 routes remaining / 3 days = 3-5 routes/day
- **Current pace:** 8 routes/day ✅ (EXCEEDING TARGET!)
- **Confidence:** HIGH - Will hit 170+ routes by Oct 31

### Technical Debt Notes
- splitadj() function may need caching for performance
- Buyback queries have complex subqueries (may need optimization)
- Template mobile responsiveness needs testing
- No automated tests yet (manual QA only)
