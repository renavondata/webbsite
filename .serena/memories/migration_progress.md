# Migration Progress Log

## Latest Status (Oct 27, 2025 - Evening Sprint)

### Production Deployment
- ✅ Site live on Render.com with continuous deployment
- ✅ **158 routes working** with full SQL implementation (+2 routes this session!)
- ✅ **295 total routes created** across all blueprints
- ✅ Database operational (PostgreSQL pro-4gb, 80GB disk)

### Evening Accomplishments (Oct 27 - Continued Sprint!)

**BATCH 2: Statistics Routes Complete! (2 routes - 1 hour)**

1. ✅ **incHKsurvive.asp** (96 lines Flask, template already existed)
   - HK company survival analysis by incorporation year
   - Google Charts stacked column (surviving vs dissolved)
   - Filter by company type (Public, Private, Limited by Guarantee, etc.)
   - Date selector for point-in-time analysis
   - Recursive CTE generates years 1865-present
   - Running totals showing cumulative survival percentages
   - Handles data quality notes (incomplete pre-1911 records, captcha issues post-2020)

2. ✅ **regHKannual.asp** (63 lines Flask, template already existed)
   - Annual registration statistics for foreign companies in HK
   - Three Google Charts visualizations:
     1. Stacked column: Registrations vs departures/dissolutions
     2. Net change per year
     3. Running total of registered companies
   - Years 1946-present (recursive CTE)
   - Tracks freg table (foreign registrations)
   - Calculates cessation as earliest of cesdate or disdate
   - PostgreSQL interval casting: `(d + INTERVAL '1 year')::date`

### Technical Highlights

**SQL Patterns Used:**
```sql
-- Survival analysis
CASE WHEN disdate IS NULL OR disdate > target_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END

-- Cessation date logic
LEAST(COALESCE(cesdate, disdate), COALESCE(disdate, cesdate))

-- Recursive year generation
WITH RECURSIVE years(y) AS (
    SELECT 1865
    UNION ALL
    SELECT y + 1 FROM years WHERE y + 1 <= EXTRACT(YEAR FROM %s::date)
)

-- PostgreSQL date casting for intervals
SELECT (d + INTERVAL '1 year')::date
```

**Column Name Corrections:**
- Fixed: `inc_date` → `incdate` (no underscore)
- Fixed: `dis_date` → `disdate` (no underscore)
- Fixed: `inc_id` → `incid` (no underscore)

### Database File Growth
- dbpub.py: 14,342 → 14,504 lines (+162 lines)
- Templates: incHKsurvive.html (fixed route name), regHKannual.html (already existed)
- Total routes in dbpub.py: **169 routes**

### Session Summary (Evening)
**Time:** ~1 hour
**Routes added:** +2 (incHKsurvive, regHKannual)
**Code added:** ~159 lines (Flask)
**Commits:** 1 (batch 2: incHKsurvive + regHKannual)

### Key Metrics
- Total routes created: **295 routes** (all blueprints)
- **Working routes: 158 (53% - up from 156!)**
- **dbpub routes: 169**
- **ccass routes: ~18**
- **other blueprints: ~108 routes**
- Stub routes: ~57 (19%)
- Functions ported: 10/10 (100%) ✅
- Procedures pending: 2
- **Today's total: +10 routes** (incHKannual, incHKmonth, incHKcaltype, disHKcaltype, oldestHKcos, buybacks, buybackstime, buybacksum, domregHK, incHKsurvive, regHKannual)

### Routes Attempted (Deferred - Complex)

**Short Selling Routes (Require Highcharts):**
- short.asp - Individual stock short positions (Highstock charts, dual Y-axis)
- shortsum.asp - Market-wide short position summary (Highstock)
- Both require:
  - Highstock JavaScript library integration
  - Complex chart configurations (range selectors, dual Y-axes)
  - Custom tooltip formatters
  - Data aggregation for time series
- **Decision:** Defer to later session (2-3 hours each)

### Estimated Remaining Work
- **Simple routes:** 2-4 hours (4-8 routes)
- **Highcharts routes:** 4-6 hours (short.asp, shortsum.asp, others)
- **Procedure porting:** 2-3 hours (2 procedures)
- **Director routes:** 3-4 hours (after procedures)
- **CCASS completion:** 1-2 hours
- **Total remaining:** 12-19 hours
- **Realistic target by Oct 31:** 165-170 working routes

### Today's Accomplishments Summary (Oct 27)
**Morning session:**
- 5 routes: incHKannual, incHKmonth, incHKcaltype, disHKcaltype, oldestHKcos
- Google Charts integration

**Afternoon session:**
- 10 financial functions ported (MAJOR milestone!)
- 1 route: buybacks.asp (complex, 211 lines)

**Late afternoon sprint:**
- 3 routes: buybackstime, buybacksum, domregHK

**Evening sprint:**
- 2 routes: incHKsurvive, regHKannual

**TOTAL TODAY: +10 routes, +10 functions, +634 lines of Flask code**

### Production Status
**Auto-deployed commits (6 commits today):**
1. Financial functions migration (10 functions)
2. buybacks.asp implementation
3. buybacksum + buybackstime implementation
4. domregHK implementation
5. incHKannual + incHKmonth + calendar routes
6. incHKsurvive + regHKannual (batch 2)

All code live on Render.com within minutes of push!

### Next Session Targets
**Quick wins (maximize routes/hour):**
1. Find templates that already exist but need routes
2. Simple aggregation pages without complex charts
3. Statistical summary pages
4. Avoid Highcharts implementations for now

**Avoid for now:**
- Highstock/Highcharts routes (short.asp, shortsum.asp)
- Complex procedures (time sink)
- Director statistics (blocked by procedures)
- Authentication routes (out of scope)

### Velocity Metrics
- **Routes/hour today:** 10 routes / ~8 hours = 1.25 routes/hour
- **Best hour:** 3 routes in 1.5 hours = 2.0 routes/hour (late afternoon)
- **Target pace:** 7-12 routes remaining / 3 days = 2-4 routes/day
- **Current pace:** 10 routes/day ✅ (FAR EXCEEDING TARGET!)
- **Confidence:** VERY HIGH - Will exceed 170 routes by Oct 31

### Technical Debt Notes
- Highcharts routes need dedicated implementation session
- Some templates reference routes that don't exist yet (incHKcaltype)
- Column name inconsistencies (underscore vs no underscore) - need documentation
- splitadj() function may need caching for performance
- Template mobile responsiveness needs testing
- No automated tests yet (manual QA only)
