# Migration Progress Log

## Latest Status (Oct 27, 2025 - Morning)

### Production Deployment
- ✅ Site live on Render.com with continuous deployment
- ✅ 150 routes working with full SQL implementation (750% of MVP target!)
- ✅ 59 stub routes remaining (21% of total)
- ✅ Database operational in production (PostgreSQL pro-4gb, 80GB disk)

### Recent Session Accomplishments (Oct 27 Morning)
Implemented 2 high-priority statistical charting routes:

1. **incHKannual.asp** - HK company incorporations by year (1865-present)
   - WITH RECURSIVE for year series generation
   - Google Charts visualization (3 interactive charts: stacked, net change, running total)
   - Filterable by company type
   - Historical data quality notes

2. **incHKmonth.asp** - Monthly incorporation/dissolution trends (1985-present)
   - DATE_TRUNC for monthly aggregation
   - Google Charts with date formatting
   - Running totals from pre-1985 baseline
   - Regulatory context about shelf company spikes

### Database File Growth
- dbpub.py: 12,588 → 12,780 lines (+192 lines, 2 new routes)
- Templates: incHKannual.html (200 lines), incHKmonth.html (190 lines)

### Technical Patterns Applied
- PostgreSQL WITH RECURSIVE for date series
- EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) for year grouping  
- DATE_TRUNC('month', date) for monthly aggregation
- Google Charts library (corechart package)
- Interactive zoom/pan with explorer option
- Responsive table column hiding (colHide1, colHide2, colHide3)

### Routes In Progress
- incHKcaltype.asp - Companies incorporated in specific year/month/day
- disHKcaltype.asp - Companies dissolved in specific year/month/day
- listingtrend.asp - Listed issuers by market over time (needs ListCosByMktAtDate() function)

### Remaining High-Priority Work
**Phase 1 Continuing:**
- incHKcaltype.asp, disHKcaltype.asp (simple listing routes)
- oldestHKcos.asp, incHKsurvive.asp (survival analysis)
- regHKannual.asp, domregHK.asp (registration stats)

**Phase 2 - Market Data:**
- listingtrend.asp (requires stored procedure port)
- buybacks.asp, buybacksum.asp (requires splitadj() function)
- short.asp, shortsum.asp, shortdate.asp (short selling)

**Phase 3 - Director Stats:**
- boardcomp.asp, dirsHKPerPerson.asp, latestdirsHK.asp
- leagueDirsHK.asp (director league table)

### Key Metrics
- Total routes created: 279
- Working routes: 150 (54%)
- Stub routes: 59 (21%)
- Missing routes: 109 (specialty/admin pages)
- Performance: 750% of MVP target (20 routes)

### Next Steps
1. Complete calendar-type routes (incHKcaltype, disHKcaltype)
2. Port MySQL stored procedures to PostgreSQL functions
3. Implement buyback and short selling routes
4. Continue with director/company statistics
