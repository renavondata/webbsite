# Migration Progress Log

## Latest Status (Oct 27, 2025 - Mid-Morning)

### Production Deployment
- ✅ Site live on Render.com with continuous deployment
- ✅ 152 routes working with full SQL implementation (760% of MVP target!)
- ✅ 57 stub routes remaining (20% of total)
- ✅ Database operational in production (PostgreSQL pro-4gb, 80GB disk)

### Recent Session Accomplishments (Oct 27 Morning - 2nd batch)
Implemented 2 additional drill-down listing routes:

3. **incHKcaltype.asp** - Companies incorporated in specific year/month/day
   - Flexible date filtering with cascading dropdowns
   - Company type filtering from orgtypes table
   - Sortable columns (9 sort options)
   - 5000 record limit with warning
   - calendar.monthrange() for day validation

4. **disHKcaltype.asp** - Companies dissolved in specific year/month/day
   - Same structure as incHKcaltype
   - Filters by dissolution date
   - Links from annual/monthly charts

### Database File Growth
- dbpub.py: 12,780 → 13,050 lines (+270 lines, 2 new routes)
- Templates: incHKcaltype.html (124 lines), disHKcaltype.html (124 lines)

### Session Summary So Far
**4 routes implemented** in this session:
1. incHKannual.asp - Annual trends with Google Charts
2. incHKmonth.asp - Monthly trends with Google Charts  
3. incHKcaltype.asp - Drill-down to specific dates
4. disHKcaltype.asp - Dissolution drill-down

**Complete navigation flow:**
- incHKannual.asp → incHKcaltype.asp (click on year)
- incHKmonth.asp → incHKcaltype.asp (click on month)
- incHKcaltype.asp → orgdata.asp (click on company)
- Same flow for dissolution routes

### Technical Patterns Applied
- Python calendar module for date validation
- Conditional JOINs (org types only when needed)
- f-string ORDER BY from whitelisted sort map
- BETWEEN clauses for date range queries
- Responsive column hiding (colHide1, colHide2)
- Cascading dropdown auto-submit

### Key Metrics
- Total routes created: 279
- Working routes: 152 (54%)
- Stub routes: 57 (20%)
- Missing routes: 109 (specialty/admin pages)
- Performance: 760% of MVP target (20 routes)
- **Session progress: +4 routes (+2.6%)**

### Next Priorities
**Simple listing routes (3-4 routes, ~2 hours):**
- oldestHKcos.asp - Oldest surviving HK companies
- incHKsurvive.asp - Company survival analysis
- regHKannual.asp - Annual registration statistics
- domregHK.asp - Domicile registration stats

**Database function porting (critical dependency):**
- ListCosByMktAtDate() - For listingtrend.asp
- splitadj() - For buybacks.asp and market cap routes

**Market data routes (after functions):**
- listingtrend.asp - Requires ListCosByMktAtDate()
- buybacks.asp - Requires splitadj()
- short.asp, shortsum.asp - Short selling data
